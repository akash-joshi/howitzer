Based on the codebase, here are several additional features you could showcase in the video:

1. **Model Selection**
- Show how users can choose between different AI models:
  - gpt-3.5-turbo (default)
  - gpt-4
  - o1-preview
  - o1-mini
- Demonstrate using the configuration command: `how --config` and selecting the "Model" option

2. **Configuration Management**
- Show how the tool persists settings between sessions
- Demonstrate the `--config` flag to manage:
  - API key configuration
  - Model selection
- Show that the API key only needs to be entered once

3. **Debug Information**
- Showcase the debug flag: `how --debug`
- This shows useful system information like:
  - Current shell
  - Platform details

4. **Smart Error Handling**
- Demonstrate how the tool automatically attempts to fix failed commands
- Show the "Fixing Errors âœ¨" spinner when it's trying to correct a command
- Show how it maintains context and improves suggestions based on error messages

5. **Context-Aware Commands**
- Show how the tool is aware of the current directory contents
- Demonstrate how it uses this information to provide more accurate commands
- Example: Show it suggesting commands based on actual files in the directory

6. **Warning System**
- Show examples where the tool provides warnings for:
  - Potentially dangerous operations
  - Missing file paths
  - Destructive commands
  - Missing inputs

7. **Interactive Confirmation**
- Show the safety feature where it asks "Do you wanna run this command?" before execution
- Demonstrate both "Yes" and "No" options

These features make the tool more powerful and safer than what was shown in the original video snippet.


 Hey folks, how are
 you doing today? I'm
 going to introduce
 how a command line
 tool
 Which allows you to
 generate explain and
 execute commands
 from your command
 line
 This is how it works.
 Firstly, you want to
 install how from
 your CLI by using NPM
 I FNG a-how this
 installs
 All of the necessary
 dependencies and
 also installs the
 how CLI globally for
 you when you run how
 for the first time
 It will ask for an
 open ebaki, but in
 this case since I
 have how configured
 already
 Let's dive right
 into it
 Firstly, let's look
 at what I already
 have in my photo
 Let's say that you
 have pdf called
 random dot pdf and
 you want to quickly
 convert it into a
 PNG because an
 online form
 somewhere
 Doesn't accept pdfs
 it only accepts PNGs
 so instead of faffing
 about with all of
 these online tools
 Let's just ask our
 CLI how we can do
 that locally so how
 do I convert
 Random to a PNG let's
 say once I hit enter
 It will then execute
 that command in the
 back end and it will
 let me know what
 that command should
 be
 So in this case, it
 is sips, iPhone S4.
 from it png random
 dot pdf out random
 dot png and it also
 explains the command
 which is that
 it converts that pdf
 into a png here. So
 I'll just execute
 this in line. Once
 that's done
 now I have random
 dot png which will
 be a png copy of
 that. So if I do ls
 la then that
 gives me the files
 and how much size
 they're doing here.
 I can also try to
 render different
 command. I can say
 how do I write
 server dot pi to
 contain Python
 server. And now in
 this
 case it actually
 generates that file
 for us. So if we run
 this command locally
 and then
 we ls it and we try
 to get it. So catch
 server dot pi then
 it also prints out
 this command.
 So if I run this
 Python file locally
 that should start
 the server as well.
 So thanks
 for watching. Hope
 you try it out. It's
 on GitHub and
 completely open
 source. And let
 me know what your
 feedback.
